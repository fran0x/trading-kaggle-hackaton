# Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for enhancing the Junz trading platform to support competitions, comprehensive evaluations, and visualization tools.

## Data Preparation

### Training Dataset
- Download 1 month of market data for participants to develop and test their strategies
- Provide this data as a standard development dataset for all participants

### Evaluation Datasets
- Create 3 distinct market data batches (3 months each) with different volatility scenarios:
  - **Low Volatility**: Steady, range-bound market conditions
  - **Medium Volatility**: Normal market conditions with moderate price swings
  - **High Volatility**: Extreme market conditions with sharp moves and potential market stress
- Keep these datasets private for fair evaluation
- Score each submission against all three scenarios to test strategy robustness

## Multi-Strategy Evaluation

### Comparative Analysis
- Adapt the scoring engine to evaluate multiple submissions simultaneously
- Generate comparative reports showing relative performance across all strategies
- Implement a leaderboard system for easy comparison
- Calculate and display the relative performance between strategies

## Visualization and Monitoring

### TradingView Integration
- Develop integration with TradingView for professional-grade charting
- Display market data for all trading pairs in a multi-chart dashboard
- Show strategy execution points (buys/sells) as overlays on charts
- Implement real-time scoring display alongside charts
- Show scores for each team on the dashboard
